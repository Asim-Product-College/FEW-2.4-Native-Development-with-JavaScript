	- What is the user experience web vs native?

## Create React Native App 

Working with Native projects is a little more complex than working with Web projects. Native projects require a few more tools. These tools compile native code to the target platform, serve the project, and simulate native hardware. 

You'll need to have Node.js 8+ for running the dev server and compiling your JS code. 

To work with React Native you'll need to have the commandline tool to create and run projects on your computer. 

To test the projects on your phone, Android or iOS, you'll need to install the Expo App. 

To test your app in a simulator on your computer you'll need to install Xcode and or Android Studio. 

To build and publish your app you'll need to Xcode for iOS and or Android Studio. 

Also to publish your native apps to the Apple App Store you'll need to have Apple Developer Account. 

This sounds like a lot, and it is, compared to web projects. This is one of the brudens of native dev. 

The easiest path to developement is to test on your device using the Expo App. Not only does React Native make this process streamlined and easy to work with, it also allows you to see your app as it will appear on a real device which is a great way to test.
